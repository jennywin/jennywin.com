                I deliver custom solutions for clients.

              <Paragraph>
                While managing multiple POCs (proofs of concept), pilots, and projects in parallel, I serve as the bridge between clients, sales, delivery, and engineering. To gain client trust, I develop an intimate knowledge of their needs, requirements, and data.<br /><br />
                What I do on the regular: client consultations, data analysis, develop workflows and processes, write scripts, draft SOWs (statements of work), and implement solutions.

                In charge of branding and website development for <Anchor href='http://www.parkbluesky.com' target='_blank' className='link'>Blue Sky Airport Parking</Anchor> in 2011, I made it my mission to change how people view airport parking. I wanted to prove that Blue Sky could be both a friendly and profitable business. To engage our target audience and convert competitors' customers, I knew we needed to be authentic. We shared helpful news and tips for our customers and launched fun giveaway contests. Blue Sky now has over 21,000 Facebook likes (for a single parking lot!).

              <Paragraph>
                Mobile is how everyone connects to each other - across the world, across cultures. I'm fascinated by what motivates people and how to engage people in today's modern age. How do we create something meaningful that builds on top of the platform that technology provides us with in order to stay connected and stay human? <strong>Leanplum.</strong>
